# KafkaMeetups

I've get asked from time to time about slides from my talks. So here are the ones from the Kafka talks that I've done. 
Content may change from time to time without warning. 

Files are PDF's and presented as is. 

Don't go stealing them and classing them as your own, that's not playing ball.
